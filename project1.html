            <h1>Built a Liar's Dice Game</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://replit.com/@mpopova/LiarsDiceGame?fbclid=IwAR2oErqs-nK1BdT8oRrk0m-_yKxdzREjsTmgmms6GewGILkIgNQPzEMbF60">Live Demo</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>The game is played by two or more players. Five dice are used per player with dice cups used for concealment.
                The game is round-based. Each round, each player rolls a “hand” of dice under their cup and looks at their hand
                while keeping it concealed from the other players. The first player begins his turn by bidding. A bid consists of
                announcing any face value and a number of dice. This bid is the player’s claim as to how many dice with that particular
                value there are on the whole table. Turns rotate among the players in a clockwise order.</p>
            <p>Each player has two choices during their turn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to make a higher bid;</li>
                <li>to challenge the previous bid, by calling the last bidder 'liar'.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Raising the bid means that the player may bid a higher quantity of the same face, or any particular quantity of a higher face.
                If the current player challenges the previous bid, all dice are revealed. If the bid is valid (there are at least as many of
                the face value as were bid), the bidder wins. Otherwise, the challenger wins. The player who loses a round loses one of their dice.
                The loser of the last round starts the bidding on the next round. If the loser of the last round was eliminated, the next player starts the new round.

            <p>Additional rule for advanced players: The 'ones' face of the dice is considered wild – it always counts as the face of the current bid.</p>
